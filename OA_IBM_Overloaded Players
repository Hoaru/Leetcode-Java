    An MMORPG game is under development. For the profile and inventory mechanics, it
needs a query that calculates a list of game accounts whose inventory is overloaded with
game items.
    The result should have the following columns: username | email | items | total_weight.
The result should be sorted in descending order by total_weight, then in ascending order
by username.

Note:
- Each item in the inventory has its own weight
- Only accounrs where the total weight of all items in the inventory exceeds the overload
- Threshold should be included in the result.
- The overload threshold is 20
- The result should have the following columns: username | email | items | total_weight.
    username -- account username
    email -- account email address
    items -- total number of items in inventory
    total_weight -- total weight of items in inventory

//SELECT username, email, items, total_weight
//FROM accounts
//WHERE total_weight > 20
//ORDERED BY username (DESC)

SELECT u.username, u.email, COUNT(i.id) AS items, SUM(i.weight) AS total_weight
FROM users u
JOIN inventory i ON u.id = i.user_id  
GROUP BY u.id
HAVING SUM(i.weight) > 20
ORDER BY total_weight DESC, username ASC;
